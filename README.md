# Plugin.ShimmerBindings
Facebook shimmer bindings for Xamarin (ios and android) imported via native bindings. I have maintained a copy of the latest bindings from the android and ios.   
Native bindings are build using cake. So first setup the cake and then run the build.sh file.
Please feel free to raise bugs under issues section.
The plugin can be easily adopted to xamarin forms. If anybody require a plugin for xamarin forms - i can consider to create a plugin for the same.
